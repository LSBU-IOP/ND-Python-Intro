## Resources

### Documentation
Python website. See the official documentation, and how to download and install on your own computer.  
https://www.python.org/

Stack overflow - if you have a question about anything Python related, its probably been asked by someone here already.   
https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python

W3schools, good for quickly looking up/revising different topics with example code snippets of different features.  
https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp

### Software
In addition to the offical Python website:

Anaconda - free software package that will install Python and contains some other useful programs. Particularly useful for scientific computing. Will install the JupyterLab program we are using in the class so you can use it on another machine.  
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Google colab - a free (with google account) online platform for writing and sharing code. Similar to JupyterLab which we are using.  
https://colab.research.google.com/

Matplotlib - ubiquitous Python data visualisation library, examples of how to make plots, graphs and animations.  
https://matplotlib.org/

### Extra coding challenges
GCSE computer science challenges.

Free book on making games with Pygame - a Python library.  
https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf

A free book on modelling and simulation in Python, good for using if you want to learn how Python can be used in science and engineering.
